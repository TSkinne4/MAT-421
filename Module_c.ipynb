        "\n",
        "Often when we are analyzing functions, we are interested in its roots. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as finding when two function are equal or when maximizing a function, and it is often useful, if not necessary, to do this numericaly.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will denote a root as $x_r$. Note that one complication that we can see is that some functions do not have roots, for example, if we try to find the root of \n",

        "we get\n",
        "$$x_r=\\ln 0,$$\n",
        "which is undefined. Thus, we must account for this in our algorithms. This usually will take the form as an iteration limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Section 19.2: Tolerance\n",
        "\n",
        "While many functions do have exact roots than can be easily expressed with a finite number of decimal points, there are some function for which this is not the case. Note that \n",
        "$$f(x)=\\cos x$$\n",
        "has a root\n",
        "$$x_r=\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$$\n",
        "While we can easily find and represent this root by hand, a computer would ideally have to store an infinite number of decimal points to properly represent it. Thus, we instead only care that the root is within some defined tolerance. We say that a root is within a tolerence, denoted $\\text{tol},$ when\n",
        "$\\left|f(x)\\right|\\leq \\text{tol}.$\n",
        "\n",
        "As well, when we are finding roots and obtain $x_i$ as a guess, we can also use $\\left|x_{i+1}-x_i\\right|$ as another form of error as the differences between guesses will decrease as we converge to a root.\n",

        "##Section 19.3: Bisection Method\n",
        "\n",
        "The bisection method is based on the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that when when $\\text{sign}(f(a))\\neq\\text{sign}(f(b))$, then if $f(x)$ is continous on the interval $a<x<b$ there exists some $a<c<b$ such that $f(x)$. The basic logic of the algorithm is as follows\n",
        "1. Obtain two bounds for the root a and b such that $\\text{sign}(f(a))\\neq\\text{sign}(f(b))$\n",
        "2. Find the midpoint of the bounds, c=(a+b)/2, which is now the guess\n",
        "3. If $\\left|f(c)\\right|<\\text{tol}$, exit as this is the root\n",
        "4. If not, replace a or b with c depending on if $\\text{sign}(f(a))=\\text{sign}(f(c))$ or $\\text{sign}(f(b))=\\text{sign}(f(c))$\n",
